# Algorithmic Menagerie Sound Engine Exhibition and Debugging GUI

INSTALL.bat will move the necessary class files to the extensions directory of SuperCollider, as well as the scd project files for the gui and exhibition code.

INSTALL.bat must be launched from within the project folder. EXHIBITION_RUN.bat and TESTING_GUI.bat both assume the standard install locations, and thus may be moved elsewhere and executed *AFTER* running INSTALL.bat.
